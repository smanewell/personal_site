            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I am currently completing a Computer Systems Technology Diploma at BCIT.  I hold a Bachelor of Applied Science in Mechanical and Biomedical Engineering from the University of British Columbia.  I am detail oriented with a strong interest in design and problem solving.</p>
            <p>I have experience in multiple design teams, both through my academic experiences at BCIT and UBC, and in professional environments during Engineering co-op terms.  In addition to my recent skills in programming and software development, I have professional experience in quality control testing and rapid prototyping, computer aided design, 3D printing, and technical reporting.</p>
